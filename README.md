## About the app
Inspired to complex blog sites this one is a simplified version that allowed me to learn and work with server side code, databases and CRUD actions. On this site the user can register and login. After they are logged in an signed as members they can: 

- Write, update and delete their stories and profile
- Create new categories
- Read all the details of other people's profiles and related stories.
The functionality to log in as a visitor is also available but in this case the user can only read stories without even seeing who is the author of it (Authentication project request).
